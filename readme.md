Summary
=======

Activity for processing Python Dictionaries and building 2D arrays

Objective (wip)
===============

ARG, matey. Your task is to put together the QR code described by a
Python Dictionary!

Prerequisites
=============

-   Basic usage of Python REPL
-   Basic understanding of processing/building Python Lists (strings are
    lists too!)

Requirements (wip)
==================

-   shell terminal or Python IDE
-   import the provided QR code activity library `q_arrgh`
-   Do you like puzzlely challenges? Yes, you do!

Desired Outcomes
================

-   Build an intuition about data represented as nested lists and
    dictionaries
-   Basic understanding of processing dictionaries
-   Basic understanding of structuring 2D arrays (nested lists)
-   Increase confort level of utilizing the REPL for development
-   Preparation for Conway's Game of Life project

Tasks (wip)
===========

Preparing the activity
----------------------

### From the terminal

1.  Clone the activity repository, change to project directory

    ``` {.bash}
    git clone https://github.com/junior-devleague/omg-not-qrcodes.git
    cd omg-not-qrcodes
    ```

2.  Create a virtual enviornment and install dependencies

    ``` {.bash}
    virtualenv -p python3 env/
    env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  start your REPL and import activity lib
    -   From terminal, enter `env/bin/python`
    -   In your newly started REPL, enter `import q_arrgh`

### Exploring the dictionary (wip)

### Visualize the data! (wip)

Fuctions that might be useful (wip)
===================================
